### Submitting Patches

We welcome PRs to this project.  Please have a look at `git log` and try
to match the commit log style.  (Note: we aren't strict about style, but
it would be nice if the commit messages were well constructed and
informative.)

Before submitting any PRs, you should verify that the changes you have
made will successfully run on CentOS Atomic Host, Fedora Atomic Host, and
RHEL Atomic Host.  If you don't have access to RHEL Atomic Host, please
note it in a comment to your PR.

### Coding Style

We try to follow the same best-practices and style guidelines from the
OpenShift Ansible team:
  - [Ansible Best Practices](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/docs/best_practices_guide.adoc#ansible)
  - [Ansible Style Guide](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/docs/style_guide.adoc#ansible)
