### Submitting Patches

We welcome PRs to this project.  Please have a look at `git log` and try
to match the commit log style.  (Note: we aren't strict about style, but
it would be nice if the commit messages were well constructed and
informative.)  The [7 Rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) are a great set of guidlines to follow.

Before submitting any PRs, you should verify that the changes you have
made will successfully run on CentOS Atomic Host, Fedora Atomic Host, and
RHEL Atomic Host.  If you don't have access to RHEL Atomic Host, please
note it in a comment to your PR.

### Reviewing Patches

In addition to welcoming PRs to this project, we also encourage users to
review incoming PRs as a way to become more familiar with the project
itself.

### Coding Style

We try to follow the same best-practices and style guidelines from the
OpenShift Ansible team:
