TEST COVERAGE

Core Functionality
  - Verify rpms package can be layered through rpm-ostree install
  - Verify multiple rpm packages can be layered through rpm-ostree install
  - Verify rpm packages can be removed through rpm-ostree uninstall
  - Verify multiple rpm packages can be removed through rpm-ostree uninstall
  - Verify rpm-ostree status output displays "Package: <pkg1> <pkg2>.." when packages are layered
  - Verify the -r / --reboot flag reboots the host after rpm-ostree install or rpm-ostree uninstall
  - Verify the -n / --dry-run flag does not perform the package add/remove function and displays a summary of packages to be installed
  - Verify a dry-run of rpm-ostree install|uninstall does not affect an existing package that has been layered, but not rebooted.
  - Verify that after additional repos are enabled (i.e. EPEL), rpm-ostree install|uninstall can be successfully used for packages in those repos.

Negative Testing
  - Verify correct error is displayed removing a package that does not exist
  - Verify correct error is displayed when adding a package that does not exists in the repo
  - Verify correct error message is displayed when adding a package that is already in the deployment
  - Verify packages which have files with non-root ownership cannot be installed
  - Verify that install/uninstall operations cannot be performed by unprivileged users
