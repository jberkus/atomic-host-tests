# This playbook is a basic security test for container images, please see
#   the tests/images_cve_scanner/vars.yml for image details.
#     - Pull container image
#     - Atomic scan specified container image
#     - Delete specified container image
#   Note: please also see roles/container_image_scanner/meta/main.yml, because
#         the default storage of Atomic Host is very limit, and some container
#         image are very big, we haven't pull all of container image then scan
#         them together.
