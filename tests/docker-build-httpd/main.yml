# !!!NOTE!!! This playbook was tested using Ansible 2.2; any other versions
# are not supported.
#
# This playbook aims to verify that the changes to the Atomic Host platform
# do not disrupt the ability for users to build/run containers built on top
# of various base images.  The base images from Docker Hub were selected
# based on 'popularity' (aka number of pulls).
#
# Each base image is used to build an httpd container, which is then run,
# and the content returned by the container is verified to be correct.
# Afterwards, the container and build image are removed from the system.
#
# In order to use less 'hacks', the playbook is actually multiple playbooks
# that are divided into setup, tests, and cleanup.  As such, this playbook
# is meant to be run in its entirety and not separately.
