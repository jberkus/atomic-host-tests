#   fail_if_found (bool) - cause the role to fail if the string is found (optional)

#
# We hide the stdout of this task, since the journal could be 1000s of lines
# This method is used because if we did something like:
#
#  'journalctl -b | grep foo'
#
# ...that command itself would show up in the journal because of how Ansible
# executes commands on the host.
