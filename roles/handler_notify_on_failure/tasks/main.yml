# vim: set ft=ansible:
#
# handler_notify_on_failure - This task will notify all handlers listening
#   for a <handler_name> to run on failure of the playbook.  Below are the
#   required guidelines for using the handler on failure.
#
#   force_handlers: true must be added to every play in a playbook
#
#   This role must be called once per pre_task, post_tasks, roles, or play.
#
#   To add a handler to run on failure the handler task must:
#     - Have when: aht_result == "1"
#     - Have listen: <handler_name>
#
#   Note: For multiple tasks, make sure each task has the same
#         listen: <handle_name>
#
#   Handlers can be added to ../handlers/main.yml if it is generic and
#   can be re-used.  For handlers specific to your playbook, create a
#   yml file with the handlers, add a handler section to your playbook,
#   and use include to pull the handlers in.
#
#     i.e.  handlers:
#             - include: 'my_handlers.yml'
#
# parameters:
#   handler_name (the unique name the handler is listening for)
#

- name: fail if handler_name is undefined
  when: handler_name is undefined
  fail:
    msg: "handler_name is undefined"

- name: Notify test status handler
  command: /bin/true
  notify:
    - h_get_status

- name: Notify {{ handler_name }}
  command: /bin/true
  notify:
    - "{{ handler_name }}"
